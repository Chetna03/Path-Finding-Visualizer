* Path Finding Visualizer project mainly focuses on finding a possible route from source to destination. 
* It aids in the visualization various algorithms in action and how these algorihtms actually work.
* It allows the user to select a starting point and an ending point.
* It also has a feature to build walls which means that position cannot be visited, and observe how algorithm works under such situation.
* It has an added feature to control the speed of algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* A* Algorithm

## Technology Used

* Java
* Java Spring Library
