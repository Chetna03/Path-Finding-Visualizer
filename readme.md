# Path Finding Visualizer

![Project](https://github.com/Chetna03/Path-Finding-Visualizer/blob/main/images/image.png)


* Path Finding Visualizer project mainly focuses on finding a possible route from source to destination. 
* It aids in the visualization various algorithms in action and how these algorihtms actually work.
* It allows the user to select a starting point and an ending point.
* It also has a feature to build walls which means that position cannot be visited, and observe how algorithm works under such situation.
* It has an added feature to control the speed of algorithm.
* It, as of now, implements 2 popular algorithms, Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm.

## Technology Used

* Java
* Java Spring Library
